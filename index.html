                <h2>Problem Statement: Calorie</h2>
                <p>
                    Our users are not properly keeping track of how many calories they are taking in each day. Most users donâ€™t have time to manually keep track of how much they are eating. Our solution will help users by tracking their caloric intake automatically.
